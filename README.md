# gw2route

This is a modified version of GW2Navi application by Drant. I only alter the use of
JWebBrowser to CefBrowser.

I modified it as my PC is using WIndows 10 and the original won't work
because of IE 11.

Original version: [GW2Navi](http://forum.renaka.com/topic/5546166/1/)

## Requirements:
* Java 8 64 bit
* Currently only support 64 Bit Windows

## Installation
* Download from here: https://github.com/ffd114/gw2route/releases
* Extract
* Double click `run.bat`

## Differences:
* Browser using [CEF](https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef). No more IE11
* About and Update button when clicked will link to [here](https://github.com/ffd114/gw2route)
